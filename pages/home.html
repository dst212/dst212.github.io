			Welcome to Emanuele De Stefani's web page.
			<br>Since this student's creativity level breaks every limit, this website will just show totally useless, not so formal contents which are absolutely devoid of any use.
			<br>
			<br>Demo page, games, and other <a href="javascript:void(Page.fetch('stuff'));" title="Stuff">here</a>.

					<h2>What's going on?</h2>
					Literally nothing, for now.
					<br>So just keep visiting this section to keep up, even if you don't care at all about this.

					<h2>Essential tips for one's existence</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Visit this website's source <a href="https://github.com/dst212/dst212.github.io" target="_blank" title="Website's source code at GitHub">at GitHub</a> to see how awful the website really is and how bad is the owner of the website in Web Development.</li>
						<li>Visit <a href="https://github.com/dst212/" target="_blank" title="dst212's GitHub profile">dst212's GitHub profile</a> to see how bad is him in programming too.</li>
						<li>Visit the old website at <a href="https://dst.altervista.org/" target="_blank" title="Home - dst212">https://dst.altervista.org/</a>. It's Italian: pizza, pasta, mandolino, spaghetti and those stuff. Also it's exactly the same as this website at first look.</li>
						<li>No more useful advices.</li>

					<h2>Existential questions</h2>
					<ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
						<li>Who invented the concept of "invention"?</li>
						<li>Who am I? (retorical question)</li>
						<li>Where do we come from? (as above)</li>
						<li>Do aliens exist? (non-retorical question)</li>
						<li>How many dead people have been photographed on Google Maps? (By <a href="https://t.me/DioDelleMele" target="_blank" title="Telegram profile of bapimLP">bapimLP</a>)</li>
					</ul>
					But above all:
					<ul><li>Why does this website even exist?</li></ul>

				<div id="todo-list">
					<h2>Stuff to do on the website<br/><small>(from the most important to the least important)</small></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Adding the "experimental" section.</li>
						<li>Adding Telegram-related section,</li>
						<li>Giving a new PC with a decent OS to <a href="http://cammmellochenqiang.altervista.org/Home.html" target="_blank">Zhang Zhou</a> (building...).</li>
						<li>Adding a multimedia player turning the website into Spotify and improving the background playing when one switches from a page to another (got around thanks to Ajax and dynamic content update).</li>
						<li>Filling the website with stuff that may at least look useful (AHAHAH it won't never happen (probably)).</li>
						<li>Adding translations (maybe).</li>
						<li>Eating an onion.</li>
						<li>Other stuff that maybe the owner of the website will remember.</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Known issues<br/><small>(aka bug)</small></h2>
			<h3>Everywhere:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Nothing for now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>On Firefox:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The <i>logo</i>, when the cursor hover over it, starts to shake during the transition if the zoom on the page is set to a number less or equal to 100% or to a multiple of 50 (e.g. 150%, 200%...) (it depends on the screen's resolution). With a different zoom one can see fluently the animation without any earthquake.</li>
				<li>The settings icon rotates as it should on hover, but shifting its position of some pixel upper. The more the website is zoomed in, the less it's visible.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 title="Chrome, Edge based on Chromium, Safari (?)...">WebKit browsers:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Transitions are effective on elements only if the ones of the <i>parent</i> element are done. So every transition will be shifted (it's clearly visible on the black/white theme change and during the <i>disco mode</i>). Setting the transition duration to <i>0</i>, everything is shown normal, but without any animation, obviously.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>If a new adorable bug pops out, please <a href="javascript:void(Page.fetch('contacts'));" title="Contacts">tell it</a> to the owner of the website, thanks for collaboration.
